- **Student Role**: Course enrollment, assignment submission, grade viewing

### ✅ Dynamic Navigation
- Navigation bars change based on user role
- Role-specific menu items and quick actions
- Visual role indicators with badges

### ✅ Authorization Checks
- Access control implemented in all controllers
- Automatic redirection for unauthorized access
- Session-based role verification

### ✅ Bootstrap UI Components
- Modern, responsive dashboard designs
- Role-specific color schemes and icons
- Interactive elements and statistics cards

## Routes Structure

### Admin Routes (`/admin/`)
- `GET /admin/dashboard` - Admin main dashboard
- `GET /admin/users` - User management interface
- `GET /admin/settings` - System settings
- `POST /admin/update-user-role` - Update user roles (AJAX)

### Teacher Routes (`/teacher/`)
- `GET /teacher/dashboard` - Teacher main dashboard
- `GET /teacher/courses` - Course management
- `GET /teacher/students` - Student oversight
- `GET /teacher/grades` - Grade management

### Student Routes (`/student/`)
- `GET /student/dashboard` - Student main dashboard
- `GET /student/courses` - Enrolled courses
- `GET /student/browse` - Browse available courses
- `GET /student/grades` - View grades
- `POST /student/enroll` - Course enrollment (AJAX)

## User Roles and Permissions

### Admin (Red Theme)
- **Full System Access**: Complete control over the LMS
- **User Management**: Create, edit, delete users and change roles
- **System Settings**: Configure system parameters
- **Statistics**: View system-wide analytics
- **Security**: Access to security settings and logs

### Teacher (Green Theme)
- **Course Management**: Create and manage courses
- **Student Oversight**: View enrolled students
- **Grade Management**: Grade assignments and quizzes
- **Content Creation**: Create lessons and assessments
- **Analytics**: View course-specific statistics

### Student (Blue Theme)
- **Course Enrollment**: Browse and enroll in available courses
- **Assignment Submission**: Submit work for grading
- **Grade Viewing**: Track academic progress
- **Course Materials**: Access lessons and resources
- **Progress Tracking**: Monitor learning progress

## Testing the Implementation

### 1. Run Database Migrations
```bash
php spark migrate
```

### 2. Seed Sample Users
```bash
php spark db:seed UserSeeder
```

### 3. Test User Accounts
- **Admin**: admin@lms.com / admin123
- **Teacher**: teacher@lms.com / teacher123
- **Student**: student@lms.com / student123

### 4. Test Role-Based Access
1. Login with different user accounts
2. Verify automatic redirection to role-specific dashboards
3. Test navigation between different sections
4. Attempt to access unauthorized URLs (should redirect)

## Security Features

### Authorization Checks
- Every controller method checks user authentication
- Role verification before allowing access
- Automatic redirection for unauthorized access attempts

### Session Management
- Secure session handling with role information
- Session timeout and security measures
- Proper logout functionality

### Input Validation
- CSRF protection on forms
- Input sanitization and validation
- SQL injection prevention

## Dashboard Features

### Admin Dashboard
- **User Statistics**: Total users by role
- **System Overview**: Recent registrations, system status
- **Quick Actions**: User management, system settings
- **User Management**: Role assignment, user oversight

### Teacher Dashboard
- **Teaching Statistics**: Courses, students, assignments
- **Course Management**: Create and manage courses
- **Grade Center**: Pending grades and submissions
- **Student Analytics**: Track student progress

### Student Dashboard
- **Learning Progress**: Enrollment status, grades
- **Course Catalog**: Browse available courses
- **Assignment Tracker**: Upcoming and completed work
- **Achievement System**: Progress indicators

## Customization Options

### Themes and Styling
- Role-specific color schemes implemented
- Easy to modify CSS variables for branding
- Responsive design for all devices

### Functionality Extensions
- Additional roles can be easily added
- New dashboard sections can be implemented
- Integration with existing course management system

## Best Practices Implemented

### Code Organization
- Separate controllers for each role
- Consistent naming conventions
- Modular view structure

### Security
- Role-based access control
- Input validation and sanitization
- Secure session management

### User Experience
- Intuitive navigation
- Visual role indicators
- Responsive design
- Clear feedback messages

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
- Course creation and management
- Assignment submission system
- Grade book functionality
- Notification system
- Advanced reporting and analytics

### Integration Possibilities
- Email notifications
- File upload system
- Calendar integration
- Mobile app support

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Access Denied**: Check user role in database
2. **Redirect Loops**: Verify session data
3. **Missing Views**: Ensure all view files are created
4. **Database Errors**: Run migrations and seeders

### Debug Tips
- Check session data: `var_dump(session()->get())`
- Verify routes: `php spark routes`
- Check database: Verify user roles in users table
- Clear cache: Delete `writable/cache` contents

## Conclusion
